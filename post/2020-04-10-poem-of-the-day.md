<p>
Who will go drive with Fergus now,<br /> 
And pierce the deep wood’s woven shade,<br /> 
And dance upon the level shore?<br /> 
Young man, lift up your russet brow,<br /> 
And lift your tender eyelids, maid,<br /> 
And brood on hopes and fears no more.<br /> 
And no more turn aside and brood<br /> 
Upon love’s bitter mystery;<br /> 
For Fergus rules the brazen cars,<br /> 
And rules the shadow of the wood,<br /> 
And the white breast of the dim sea<br /> 
And all disheveled wandering stars.<br /> 
</p>
